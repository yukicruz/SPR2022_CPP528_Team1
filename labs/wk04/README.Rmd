Lab 05: Adding Federal Program Data

Used the difference-in-difference framework to estimate the impact of each federal program: the NMTC and the LIHTC.

About the NMTC Program
The NMTC Program enables economically distressed communities to leverage private investment capital by providing investors with a federal tax credit.

About the LIHTC Program
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is the most important resource for creating affordable housing in the United States today.
The LIHTC database, created by HUD and available to the public since 1997, contains information on 47,511 projects and 3.13 million housing units placed in service between 1987 and 2017.

Used previsouly built baseline model predicting tract change from Lab 04 as the starting point.

Created a log-linear diff-in-diff model following these steps and added control variables from Lab 04.

Interpreted the main results from the models are assuming median home value captures the increased market demand that reflects the desirability of improvements.
